    <h1 class="title">About Eugene</h1>
    <h3 class="intro">Eugene is my dad's uncle, and he made it to the US in 1991. He received a lot of support from his family and the Jewish community in
      San Francisco, and got a job as a programmer, the beginning of a long career. Today, he's a professor of innovation and
      entrepreneurship at Stanford University.</h3>
