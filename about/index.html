    <h1 class="title">About This Project</h1>
    <h3 class="intro">This was a project for my world literature class, but it turned into a lot more. It's one of the first functional
      web pages I've made, and it really helped me to connect with my family and our collective history. I learned a lot
      of things about Eugene, Nata, my dad, and the Soviet Union. It's been an honor presenting their incredible
      stories in this way, and I hope that it's helped you to understand the challenges and choices they faced in and outside the USSR.</h3>
