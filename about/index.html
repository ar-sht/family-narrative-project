    <h3 class="intro">
      This was a project for my history/literature class, but it turned into a lot more. It's one of the first functional
      web pages I've made, and it really helped me to connect with my family and our collective history. I learned a lot
      of things about Eugene, Nata, my dad, the Soviet Union and even myself. It's been an honor presenting these incredible
      stories in such a way, and I hope that it's helped you to understand the challenges and choices faced in the USSR.
