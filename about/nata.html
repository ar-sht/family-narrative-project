    <h1 class="title">About Nata & Max</h1>
    <h3 class="intro">Nata is my paternal grandmother, and she and my dad made it to the US in late 1989. They initially worked as cleaners and babysitters,
      despite Nata's engineering qualifications, but eventually with community and family support they overcame the language
      barrier and discriminations they faced as Jewish immigrants, and Nata found work for a number of companies as an engineer, and
      now is a client-communicator engineer-y thing (she tells clients what engineers could do and engineers what clients wanted).
      She's retiring in June after a long, successful career, and my dad works as a professor of materials science and engineering
      at the University of Michigan.</h3>
