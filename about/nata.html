    <h1 class="title">About Nata</h1>
    <h3 class="intro">
      Nata is my paternal grandmother, and she and my dad made it to the US in late 1989. They initially worked as cleaners,
      despite Nata's engineering qualifications, but eventually with community support they were able to overcome the language
      barrier and the discriminations they faced as immigrants, and Nata worked for a number of companies as an engineer, and
      later as a client-communicator engineer-y thing (she told clients what engineers could do and engineers what clients wanted).
      She's retiring in June after a long, successful career, and my dad now works as a professor of material science and engineering
      at the University of Michigan.
