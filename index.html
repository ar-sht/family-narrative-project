      <h1 class="title">Welcome to the USSR</h1>
      <h3 class="intro">You will take the role of one of my relatives living in the Soviet Union. Your goal is to get out,
        and make a better, fairer life for yourself in the US. You can play as Eugene (my great uncle) and navigate the challenges
        he faced in the Soviet Union, or as Nata (my grandmother) and go through the grueling immigration process that she did.</h3>
        <span class="disclaimer">Disclaimer kind of thing: Part of this assignment was fictionalization so some of these stories
          (especially the theoretical storylines from decisions that my relatives didn't make) aren't factual, so keep 
          that in mind as you play.<br>Alright, enjoy!
